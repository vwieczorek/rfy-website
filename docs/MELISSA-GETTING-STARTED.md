# Getting Started: Managing the RFY Website

**Welcome, Melissa!** This guide will help you manage the Reach For Youth website independently.

---

## What You'll Be Able to Do

- ✅ Update text, photos, staff info, stats, testimonials
- ✅ Add new content (events, stories, volunteer opportunities)
- ✅ Make changes that go live automatically in ~30 seconds
- ✅ Use AI (Claude) to help with more advanced edits
- ✅ Full ownership — no dependency on Victor for day-to-day updates

## Two Ways to Edit

| Method | Best For | Skill Level |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| **Web CMS** | Quick content updates (text, photos, stats) | Easy — like editing a Google Doc |
| **Claude Desktop** | Design changes, new pages, complex edits | Intermediate — AI guides you |

**Start with the Web CMS.** It handles 90% of what you'll need. Graduate to Claude Desktop when you're comfortable.

## Step 1: Get a GitHub Account

GitHub is where the website files live. You need a free account to make changes.

1. Go to [github.com/signup](https://github.com/signup)
2. Create an account with your work email (melissa@reachforyouth.org recommended)
3. **Save your password somewhere safe** (1Password, written down, etc.)
4. Tell Victor your GitHub username so he can give you access

**Why GitHub?** It's like Google Drive for code — tracks every change, lets you undo mistakes, and powers the automatic updates.

## Step 2: Accept the Repository Invitation

Once Victor adds you as a collaborator:

1. Check your email for an invitation from GitHub
2. Click "Accept invitation"
3. You now have access to edit the website!

---

## Step 3: Log Into the Content Manager

1. Open your browser
2. Go to: **https://rfy.thewicksproject.org/admin/**
3. Click **"Login with GitHub"**
4. Authorize the connection (first time only)
5. You're in!

**Bookmark this link** — it's your main editing dashboard.

## Making Your First Edit

Let's update something simple to see how it works:

1. In the CMS, click **Site Settings** → **Organization Info**
2. Find a field (like the tagline) and make a small change
3. Click **Publish** (top right)
4. Wait 30 seconds
5. Open https://rfy.thewicksproject.org in a new tab
6. See your change live!

**Congratulations!** You just updated the website.

## Tips for Success

### Before Publishing
- **Preview your changes** — Open the live site in another tab to compare
- **Save drafts** — Use "Save" (not "Publish") if you're not ready

### Images
- **Size limit:** Under 5MB
- **Formats:** JPG or PNG work best
- **Tip:** Compress large photos at [squoosh.app](https://squoosh.app) first

### If Something Goes Wrong
- Every change is saved in GitHub history
- You can always undo by contacting Victor
- The site auto-rebuilds, so wait 60 seconds before panicking
