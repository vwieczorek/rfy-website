# Getting Started: Managing the RFY Website

This guide walks you through taking ownership of the Reach For Youth website. Once set up, you can update content, add photos, and make changes that go live automatically. No waiting on anyone else.

---

## What You'll Be Able to Do

- Update text, photos, staff profiles, statistics, testimonials
- Add new content (events, stories, volunteer opportunities)
- See changes go live automatically in about 30 seconds
- Use AI assistance for more complex edits when needed

---

## Two Ways to Edit

| Method | Best For | Skill Level |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| **Web CMS** | Quick content updates (text, photos, stats) | Easy, similar to editing a Google Doc |
| **Claude Desktop** | Design changes, new pages, complex edits | More involved, but AI guides you through it |

Start with the Web CMS. It handles most of what you'll need day-to-day.

## Step 1: Create a GitHub Account

GitHub is where the website files live. You'll need a free account to make changes.

1. Go to [github.com/signup](https://github.com/signup)
2. Create an account (your work email is fine)
3. Save your password somewhere safe
4. Send Victor your GitHub username so he can grant you access

GitHub works like a version-controlled file system. It tracks every change and lets you undo mistakes. All the automation runs through it.

---

## Step 2: Accept the Repository Invitation

Once Victor adds you as a collaborator:

1. Check your email for an invitation from GitHub
2. Click "Accept invitation"
3. You now have access to edit the website

---

## Step 3: Log Into the Content Manager

1. Open your browser
2. Go to: **https://rfy.thewicksproject.org/admin/**
3. Click **"Login with GitHub"**
4. Authorize the connection (first time only)

Bookmark this link. It's your main editing dashboard.

---

## Making Your First Edit

Try something simple to see how the flow works:

1. In the CMS, click **Site Settings** then **Organization Info**
2. Find a field (like the tagline) and make a small change
3. Click **Publish** (top right)
4. Wait about 30 seconds
5. Open the live site in a new tab: https://rfy.thewicksproject.org
6. Refresh and see your change

That's the whole process. Edit, publish, wait, done.

## If Something Goes Wrong

Every change is saved in GitHub's history. Nothing is permanent until you want it to be. If you make a mistake, you can always go back. Reach out to Victor for help rolling back if needed.
